In this project we have initially done an Exploratory Data Analysis 
We also created a prediction model of employee turnover using Logistic Regression and Random Forest on the Employee dataset available on kaggle.
In the initial Exploratory Data Analysis, we dived into the data to get answers on:
i) Percentage of employee who had been benched in the company during their course
ii) Cities to which the employees belong to
iii) Attrition Rate of the company
iv) Visualising the age distibution of the employees
v) Visualising the % of employees who joined after completing their bachelors,masters and PHD
vi) Visualising the gender distribution
vii) Visualising the number of employees under each Payment Tiers

The accuracy score for LogisticRegression=73.25 %
The accuracy score for Random Forest = 77.55 %
